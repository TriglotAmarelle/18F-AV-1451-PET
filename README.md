# 18F-AV-1451-PET

The relationship between tau PET and CSF tau proteins in Alzheimer’s Disease, and their diagnostic
performance is still debatable. This study attempted to clarify whether CSF tau levels can be used to
predict the values of the 18F-AV-1451 tracer which has been used in tau PET scans. Furthermore, the
study encompassed the selection of brain regions with tracer uptakes that have the strongest and
weakest correlations with CSF tau levels, and the uptake values from these brain regions were
implemented into a semi-supervised support vector machine, with the aim to distinguish between
cognitively normal and cognitively impaired subjects. Eventually, the same algorithm was used to
determine which of these two types of biomarkers yields the most accurate diagnostic predictions.
These experiments were performed by using data provided by Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative, and their results suggest that t-tau is the best predictor of 18F-AV-1451 tracer values. The
regions whose tracer uptake manifested the strongest correlations with both t-tau and p-tau are
predominantly regions of the temporal lobe, and they perform better at detecting cognitive impairment
than regions that are not correlated as strongly. Finally, no evidence was found that either 18F-AV1451 PET or CSF levels are better predictors of cognitive impairment.
